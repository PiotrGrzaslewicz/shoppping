Just Shopping App

This app creates powerful and functional shopping lists. The user can dynamically change them, add new categories for products to sort them.
The shopping mode provides changing status for products - bought/not availble/delete. When all the products from specific category are flagged, the category switches into "complete".
The app also provides summary from shopping - the user can create a memo/note in which he/she can store information for further shopping - if some products where unavailble.
